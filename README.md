Analyzing Steve Kerr's lineup combinations 

The Golden State Warriors are an offensive juggernaut averaging a +12.85 point differential against their opponents so far during the 2017-18 NBA season (through January 26th). 

As the second fastest team (102.4 PACE), the Warriors aggressively flush shots inside the paint (less than 5 feet from the rim). For example, when healthy and in the lineup, over 60% Jordan Bell, Kevin Looney, and Zaza Pachuliaâ€™s shots come 0-3 feet from the basket according to Basketball Reference.
